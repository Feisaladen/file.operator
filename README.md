# Python File Operations Demo

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates basic file operations:
- Creating a file
- Writing content to a file
- Reading file content
- Updating (overwriting) file content
- Reading the updated content

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter a file name.
2. It creates the file and writes the first version of the content.
3. It reads the file and prints the content to the terminal.
4. The file content is updated with a new version.
5. It reads the updated file and prints the new content.
